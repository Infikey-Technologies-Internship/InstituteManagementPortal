## Manual The previous system was inefficient, ineffective, and had issues with redundancy and consistency. It was also expensive, difficult to maintain, required more labour, and could not handle large records.

### By requiring user authentication, this system protects data, and in this project, user rights are outlined. In this system, the administrator is the primary user and has complete access to all modules within the proposed system. The other user, who is a college faculty and may also be a teacher within the college, has limited access to the system and is responsible for managing the attendance and grades of the students. This product allows for the generation of a variety of reports, including student information, attendance reports, test reports etc.

The main modules which are focused on this project: \
-Admin Management \
-Student management \
-Faculty management \
-User registration \
-Internal Marks of students \
-Attendance of students \
-Reports of studentsâ€™ tests
